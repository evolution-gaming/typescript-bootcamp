# TypeScript Declaration Files Playground

## Description

Here you can find examples of using declaration files (`.d.ts`) for:

- Defining types for `.js` files (`lib` folder).
- Declaring global objects and modules for further usage in the project
  (`global-types/declaration.d.ts`).
- Expanding native interfaces or third-party modules' functionality
  (`global-types/global.d.ts`).
- Adding additional global utility types
  (`global-types/CustomUtilityTypes.d.ts`).

To play with it by yourself, just go to the `ts-declaration-files` folder and
run `npm install`. And feel free to do what you want!

This example is some kind of part of lecture
[TypeScript. Advanced.pptx](../3.%20TypeScript.%20Advanced.pptx) but feel free
to consider it at any time on your own.

## Useful Links

To dive very deep to this theme you need to reference to the topic
[Declaration Files](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html).

To use separate defined TypeScript types or contribute types to some packages,
(it is concerned only those package that do not include types on their own)
see [Definitely Typed](https://definitelytyped.org/) and their
[GitHub](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped).
